# 🚀 Get Started - Your Next Steps

Welcome! Your PHP Employee Management application is ready to run. Follow these simple steps to get started.

## ✅ System Check

**Your System Status:**
- ✅ PHP 8.4.12 - Installed and ready
- ✅ MySQL - Installed (needs to be started)
- ✅ Application files - Ready

## 📝 Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start MySQL (Required)

```bash
# Start MySQL service
brew services start mysql
```

**Verify MySQL is running:**
```bash
brew services list | grep mysql
# Should show: mysql started
```

### Step 2: Create Database

```bash
# Login to MySQL (press Enter if no password is set)
mysql -u root -p

# You should see: mysql>
```

**Then run these commands in MySQL:**
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE php_employee_management;

-- Verify it was created
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Exit MySQL
EXIT;
```

**Or use the quick method:**
```bash
# Import the complete database schema with sample data
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Configure Application

The application is already configured with default settings:
- **Host:** localhost
- **User:** root
- **Password:** (empty)
- **Database:** php_employee_management

If your MySQL has a password, update `config.php`:
```php
define('DB_PASS', 'your_mysql_password');
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/admin/ysa-edu.website/PHP-MySQL-Employee-Management-CRUD

# Start the server
./start-server.sh
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Visit these URLs:
1. **Test Connection:** http://localhost:8000/test-connection.php
   - This will verify your database connection
   - Should show ✅ green success messages

2. **Application:** http://localhost:8000/index.php
   - Your employee management system
   - Should display sample employees

## 🎯 Quick Commands

### All-in-One Setup
```bash
# 1. Start MySQL
brew services start mysql

# 2. Create database (if not exists)
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS php_employee_management;"

# 3. Import schema
mysql -u root -p php_employee_management < database/schema.sql

# 4. Start application
./start-server.sh
```

### Daily Use
```bash
# Start the application
./start-server.sh

# Stop the application
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if MySQL is running
brew services list | grep mysql

# Start MySQL if not running
brew services start mysql

# Test connection
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT 1"
```

### Issue: "Database doesn't exist"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create and import database
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
```

### Issue: "Access denied for user 'root'"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Try without password
mysql -u root

# Or reset MySQL password
mysql -u root
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### Issue: "Port 8000 already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use a different port
php -S localhost:8080
```
